					<description>At its most basic, an employer brand is your reputation among the workforce as well as your employees' perception of you as an employer.

In other words, employer branding is how you market your company to job seekers and internal employees. The better you are at employer branding, the more likely you are to attract top talent. Additionally, a positive employer brand can also help you retain top talent.

Let's say you've done a phenomenal job building up a strong brand in relation to your products or services. Unfortunately, that alone won't convince someone to work at, or stay at, your company. You need to implement the same branding strategy when it comes to communicating your company's leadership, values, and culture. </description>

					<description>Life is full of big decisions. And, nine times out of ten, they're not ones you want to jump into without a little thought or pre-planning.

The same can be said about your business and its marketing activities. You're not executing campaigns just for the sake of it, and you'll struggle to justify your spend without real thought behind what you want to get back from it. You're working towards something. You're working towards a goal. You perhaps just haven't defined what that looks like — yet.

According to an industry survey of more than 3,200 marketers, those who set goals were 376% more likely to report success than those who didn't.

Goals are there to provide clarity, purpose, direction and vision. Whether personal or commercial, they are what lead to success for you, your department, and the business as a whole. Hitting your goal proves you're making an impact. We all want to feel like we're contributing, right? </description>

					<description>Your ecommerce marketing plan is essentially the sum of the ecommerce strategies and tactics you choose to employ. The most effective plans aren't randomly cobbled together — they're designed with intention. They're often guided by a general marketing philosophy or underlying structure.

For instance, the inbound methodology can be applied to an overarching ecommerce marketing plan. In this case, you would tailor your ecommerce marketing efforts to attract visitors, convert those visitors into leads, close deals and turn them into customers, and delight them once they've purchased your products or services to turn them into promoters.

There are a number of different strategies to consider when constructing your plan. Here are some of the most effective options worth exploring.</description>

					<description>Today, I’m cringe-laughing as I write these sentences. The perception I had of management turned out to be quite different than the brass tacks realities. Spoiler: I did not ascend to a higher plane of enlightenment when my title changed. I was still myself, with all my faults, and dealing with a totally new set of challenges.

Don’t get me wrong -- for all the missteps and pitfalls and uncomfortable realizations, being a manager is easily the best job I’ve ever had. The phrase “the best hardest job” that often gets applied to parenting also holds for management in my opinion. The fulfillment I get from watching my team learn, grow, and ultimately kick ass is second to none.

This post is not intended to dissuade anyone from management. Instead, it’s an attempt to provide a glimpse into the not-so-glamorous parts of “running sh*t” that don’t get talked about as often as the pros. It’s my hope that this information can help people considering management make a fully informed decision -- and let current managers know that if they’re experiencing any of the things on this list, they’re not alone.</description>
